        <p>Grilled cod fillets perfect for lunch.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2> 
        <ul>
            <li>2 (8 ounce) fillets cod, cut in half </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning </li>
            <li>½ teaspoon lemon pepper </li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt </li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter </li>
            <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped green onion (white part only)</li>
        </ul>   
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Stack about 15 charcoal briquettes into a grill in a pyramid shape. If desired, drizzle coals lightly with lighter fluid and allow to soak for 1 minute before lighting coals with a match.</li>
            <li>Allow fire to spread to all coals, about 10 minutes, before spreading briquettes out into the grill; let coals burn until a thin layer of white ash covers the coals.</li>
            <li>Lightly oil the grates.</li>
            <li>Season both sides of cod with Cajun seasoning, lemon pepper, salt, and black pepper. </li>
            <li>Set fish aside on a plate.</li>
            <li>Heat butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, stir in lemon juice and green onion, and cook until onion is softened, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place cod onto oiled grates and grill until fish is browned and flakes easily, about 3 minutes per side; baste with butter mixture frequently while grilling.</li>
            <li>Allow cod to rest off the heat for about 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
